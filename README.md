# Bridges-and-Articulation-points
An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which,
when removed along with associated edges,makes the graph disconnected .
(or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph)


A bridge is defined as an edge which, when removed,makes the graph disconnected .
(or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph)
